== Stateful Stream Processing

NOTE: Consider this page as _work in progress_ until the note disappears.

*Stateful Stream Processing* is a stream processing with state.

In Spark Structured Streaming, a streaming query is an example of stateful streaming processing when uses the following operators (or their SQL variants):

* <<spark-sql-streaming-Dataset-operators.adoc#withWatermark, Dataset.withWatermark>>
* <<spark-sql-streaming-Dataset-operators.adoc#groupBy, Dataset.groupBy>>
* <<spark-sql-streaming-Dataset-operators.adoc#groupByKey, Dataset.groupByKey>>
* ...

Regardless of the query language (<<spark-sql-streaming-Dataset-operators.adoc#, Dataset API>> or SQL) they are meant to create a query plan that <<IncrementalExecution, IncrementalExecution>> plans for execution.

State could be implicit or explicit.

=== [[IncrementalExecution]] IncrementalExecution -- QueryExecution of Streaming Queries

<<spark-sql-streaming-IncrementalExecution.adoc#, IncrementalExecution>> is the `QueryExecution` of streaming queries with the following execution planning strategies that are relevant for stateful stream processing:

* <<spark-sql-streaming-StatefulAggregationStrategy.adoc#, StatefulAggregationStrategy>>
* ...
