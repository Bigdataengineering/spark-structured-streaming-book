== Stateful Stream Processing

NOTE: Consider this page as _work in progress_ until the note disappears.

*Stateful Stream Processing* is a stream processing with an implicit or explicit state.

In Spark Structured Streaming, a streaming query is an example of stateful streaming processing when it uses the following operators (or their SQL variants):

* <<spark-sql-streaming-Dataset-operators.adoc#withWatermark, Dataset.withWatermark>>
* <<spark-sql-streaming-Dataset-operators.adoc#groupBy, Dataset.groupBy>>
* <<spark-sql-streaming-Dataset-operators.adoc#groupByKey, Dataset.groupByKey>>
* <<spark-sql-streaming-Dataset-operators.adoc#dropDuplicates, Dataset.dropDuplicates>>
* `Dataset.join`
* ...

Regardless of the query language (<<spark-sql-streaming-Dataset-operators.adoc#, Dataset API>> or SQL), any structured query (incl. streaming queries) becomes a logical query plan that <<spark-sql-streaming-IncrementalExecution.adoc#, IncrementalExecution>> plans for execution.

=== State Management

The state in a stateful streaming query can be implicit or explicit.
