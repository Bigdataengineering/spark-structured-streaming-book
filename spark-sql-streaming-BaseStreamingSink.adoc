== [[BaseStreamingSink]] BaseStreamingSink Contract -- Base of Streaming Sinks

`BaseStreamingSink` is the abstraction of <<extensions, streaming writers and sinks>> with the only purpose of sharing a common abstraction between the former Data Source API V1 (<<Sink, Sink API>>) and the modern Data Source API V2 (until Spark Structured Streaming migrates to the Data Source API V2 fully).

`BaseStreamingSink` defines no methods.
