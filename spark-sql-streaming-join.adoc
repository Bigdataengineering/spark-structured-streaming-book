== Streaming Join

In Spark Structured Streaming, a streaming query is an example of *streaming join* when it uses `Dataset.join` or SQL's `JOIN` high-level query operators.

Under the covers, the high-level operators create a logical query plan with one or more `Join` logical operators.

In Spark Structured Streaming it is <<spark-sql-streaming-IncrementalExecution.adoc#, IncrementalExecution>> that plans streaming queries for execution.

While <<spark-sql-streaming-IncrementalExecution.adoc#executedPlan, planning a streaming query for execution>> (aka _query planning_), `IncrementalExecution` uses the <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamingJoinStrategy.adoc#, StreamingJoinStrategy>> execution planning strategy for planning streaming joins (`Join` logical operators) as <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec.adoc#, StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec>> physical operators.
