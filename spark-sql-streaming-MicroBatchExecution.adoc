== [[MicroBatchExecution]] MicroBatchExecution -- Stream Execution Engine of Micro-Batch Stream Processing

`MicroBatchExecution` is a <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamExecution.adoc#, stream execution engine>> of <<spark-sql-streaming-micro-batch-processing.adoc#, Micro-Batch Stream Processing>>.

`MicroBatchExecution` is <<creating-instance, created>> when `StreamingQueryManager` is requested to <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQueryManager.adoc#createQuery, create a streaming query>> (when `DataStreamWriter` is requested to <<spark-sql-streaming-DataStreamWriter.adoc#start, start an execution of the streaming query>>) with the following:

* Any type of <<sink, sink>> but <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamWriteSupport.adoc#, StreamWriteSupport>>

* Any type of <<trigger, trigger>> but <<spark-sql-streaming-Trigger.adoc#ContinuousTrigger, ContinuousTrigger>>

[[BATCH_ID_KEY]][[streaming.sql.batchId]]
`MicroBatchExecution` defines *streaming.sql.batchId* local property for the current *batch* or *epoch IDs* that is used for the following:

* `DataWritingSparkTask` is requested to run

* `MicroBatchExecution` is requested to <<runBatch, run a single streaming micro-batch>>

=== [[populateStartOffsets]] Populating Start Offsets -- `populateStartOffsets` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
populateStartOffsets(sparkSessionToRunBatches: SparkSession): Unit
----

`populateStartOffsets` requests <<offsetLog, OffsetSeqLog>> for the link:spark-sql-streaming-HDFSMetadataLog.adoc#getLatest[latest committed batch id with its metadata if available].

NOTE: The batch id could not be available in metadata log if a streaming query started with a new metadata log or no batch was committed before.

With the latest committed batch id with the metadata (from <<offsetLog, OffsetSeqLog>>) `populateStartOffsets` sets <<currentBatchId, current batch id>> to the latest committed batch id, and <<availableOffsets, availableOffsets>> to its offsets (considering them unprocessed yet).

NOTE: `populateStartOffsets` may re-execute the latest committed batch.

If the latest batch id is greater than `0`, `populateStartOffsets` requests <<offsetLog, OffsetSeqLog>> for the link:spark-sql-streaming-HDFSMetadataLog.adoc#getLatest[second latest batch with its metadata] (or reports a `IllegalStateException` if not found). `populateStartOffsets` sets <<committedOffsets, committed offsets>> to the second latest committed offsets.

`populateStartOffsets` updates the offset metadata.

CAUTION: FIXME Why is the update needed?

`populateStartOffsets` requests <<batchCommitLog, BatchCommitLog>> for the link:spark-sql-streaming-HDFSMetadataLog.adoc#getLatest[latest processed batch id with its metadata if available].

(only when the latest batch in <<offsetLog, OffsetSeqLog>> is also the latest batch in <<batchCommitLog, BatchCommitLog>>) With the latest processed batch id with the metadata (from <<batchCommitLog, BatchCommitLog>>), `populateStartOffsets` sets <<currentBatchId, current batch id>> as the next after the latest processed batch. `populateStartOffsets` sets <<committedOffsets, committed offsets>> to <<availableOffsets, availableOffsets>>.

CAUTION: FIXME Describe what happens with `availableOffsets`.

`populateStartOffsets` <<constructNextBatch, constructs the next streaming micro-batch>>.

CAUTION: FIXME Describe the WARN message when `latestCommittedBatchId < latestBatchId - 1`.

[options="wrap"]
----
WARN Batch completion log latest batch id is [latestCommittedBatchId], which is not trailing batchid [latestBatchId] by one

`populateStartOffsets` prints out the following DEBUG message to the logs:

```
Resuming at batch [currentBatchId] with committed offsets [committedOffsets] and available offsets [availableOffsets]
```

CAUTION: FIXME Include an example of Resuming at batch

When the latest committed batch id with the metadata could not be found in <<batchCommitLog, BatchCommitLog>>, `populateStartOffsets` prints out the following INFO message to the logs:

```
no commit log present
```

CAUTION: FIXME Include an example of the case when no commit log present.

When the latest committed batch id with the metadata could not be found in <<offsetLog, OffsetSeqLog>>, it is assumed that the streaming query is started for the first time.

`populateStartOffsets` prints out the following INFO message to the logs:

```
Starting new streaming query.
```

[[populateStartOffsets-currentBatchId-0]]
`populateStartOffsets` sets <<currentBatchId, current batch id>> to `0` and <<constructNextBatch, constructs the next streaming micro-batch>>.

NOTE: `populateStartOffsets` is used exclusively when `MicroBatchExecution` is requested to <<runActivatedStream, runActivatedStream>>.

=== [[runActivatedStream]] Running Activated Streaming Query -- `runActivatedStream` Method

[source, scala]
----
runActivatedStream(sparkSessionForStream: SparkSession): Unit
----

NOTE: `runActivatedStream` is part of <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamExecution.adoc#runActivatedStream, StreamExecution Contract>> to run the activated streaming query.

`runActivatedStream`...FIXME

=== [[logicalPlan]] Resolving Analyzed Logical Plan of Streaming Query -- `logicalPlan` Property

[source, scala]
----
logicalPlan: LogicalPlan
----

NOTE: `logicalPlan` is part of <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamExecution.adoc#logicalPlan, StreamExecution Contract>> to resolve the analyzed logical plan of a streaming query.

`logicalPlan` resolves (_replaces_) <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamingRelation.adoc#, StreamingRelation>>, <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamingRelationV2.adoc#, StreamingRelationV2>> logical operators to <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamingExecutionRelation.adoc#, StreamingExecutionRelation>> logical operators.

NOTE: `logicalPlan` is a Scala lazy value and so the resolution happens only once at the first access and is cached for later use afterwards.

Internally, `logicalPlan`...FIXME

=== [[constructNextBatch]] Constructing Next Streaming Micro-Batch -- `constructNextBatch` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
constructNextBatch(): Unit
----

`constructNextBatch` is made up of the following three parts:

. Firstly, <<constructNextBatch-hasNewData, checking if there is new data available>> by requesting new offsets from every streaming source

. <<constructNextBatch-hasNewData-true, There is some data to process>> (and so the next batch is constructed)

. <<constructNextBatch-hasNewData-false, No data is available>>

NOTE: `constructNextBatch` is used exclusively when `MicroBatchExecution` is requested to <<runActivatedStream, run the activated streaming query>>.

==== [[constructNextBatch-hasNewData]] Checking Whether New Data Is Available (by Requesting New Offsets from Sources)

`constructNextBatch` starts by checking whether or not a new data is available in any of the streaming sources (in the <<logicalPlan, logical query plan>>).

`constructNextBatch` acquires <<awaitProgressLock, awaitProgressLock>> and link:spark-sql-streaming-Source.adoc#getOffset[gets the latest offset] from <<uniqueSources, every streaming data source>>.

NOTE: `constructNextBatch` checks out the latest offset in every streaming data source sequentially, i.e. one data source at a time.

.StreamExecution's Getting Offsets From Streaming Sources
image::images/StreamExecution-constructNextBatch.png[align="center"]

NOTE: `constructNextBatch` uses the `Source` contract to link:spark-sql-streaming-Source.adoc#getOffset[get the latest offset] (using `Source.getOffset` method).

`constructNextBatch` link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#updateStatusMessage[updates the status message] to *Getting offsets from [source]* for every streaming data source.

In *getOffset* link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#reportTimeTaken[time-tracking section], `constructNextBatch` gets the offsets.

`constructNextBatch` prints out the following DEBUG message to the logs:

```
getOffset took [time] ms
```

`constructNextBatch` adds the streaming sources that have the available offsets to <<availableOffsets, availableOffsets>>.

If there is no <<dataAvailable, data available>> (i.e. no offsets unprocessed in any of the streaming data sources), `constructNextBatch` turns <<noNewData, noNewData>> flag on.

In the end (of this checking-data block), `constructNextBatch` releases <<awaitProgressLock, awaitProgressLock>>

==== [[constructNextBatch-hasNewData-true]] New Data Available

When new data is available, `constructNextBatch` updates the event time watermark (tracked using <<offsetSeqMetadata, offsetSeqMetadata>>) if it finds one in the <<spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#lastExecution, last IncrementalExecution>>.

If <<spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#lastExecution, lastExecution>> is available (which may not when `constructNextBatch` is executed the very first time), `constructNextBatch` takes the executed physical plan (i.e. `SparkPlan`) and collects all `EventTimeWatermarkExec` physical operators with the count of link:spark-sql-streaming-EventTimeWatermarkExec.adoc#eventTimeStats[eventTimeStats] greater than `0`.

NOTE: The executed physical plan is available as `executedPlan` property of link:spark-sql-streaming-IncrementalExecution.adoc[IncrementalExecution] (which is a custom `QueryExecution`).

`constructNextBatch` prints out the following DEBUG message to the logs:

```
Observed event time stats: [eventTimeStats]
```

`constructNextBatch` calculates the difference between the maximum value of `eventTimeStats` and link:spark-sql-streaming-EventTimeWatermarkExec.adoc#delayMs[delayMs] for every `EventTimeWatermarkExec` physical operator.

NOTE: The maximum value of `eventTimeStats` is the youngest time, i.e. the time the closest to the current time.

`constructNextBatch` then takes the first difference (if available at all) and uses it as a possible new event time watermark.

If the event time watermark candidate is greater than the current watermark (i.e. later time-wise), `constructNextBatch` prints out the following INFO message to the logs:

```
Updating eventTime watermark to: [newWatermarkMs] ms
```

`constructNextBatch` creates a new <<offsetSeqMetadata, OffsetSeqMetadata>> with the new event time watermark and the current time.

Otherwise, if the eventTime watermark candidate is not greater than the current watermark, `constructNextBatch` simply prints out the following DEBUG message to the logs:

```
Event time didn't move: [newWatermarkMs] <= [batchWatermarkMs]
```

`constructNextBatch` creates a new <<offsetSeqMetadata, OffsetSeqMetadata>> with just the current time.

NOTE: Although `constructNextBatch` collects all the `EventTimeWatermarkExec` physical operators in the executed physical plan of <<spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#lastExecution, lastExecution>>, only the first matters if available.

NOTE: A physical plan can have as many `EventTimeWatermarkExec` physical operators as link:spark-sql-streaming-Dataset-withWatermark.adoc[withWatermark] operator was used to create a streaming query.

[NOTE]
====
link:spark-sql-streaming-WatermarkSupport.adoc[Streaming watermark] can be changed between a streaming query's restarts (and be different between what is checkpointed and the current version of the query).

FIXME True? Example?
====

`constructNextBatch` then adds the offsets to metadata log.

`constructNextBatch` link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#updateStatusMessage[updates the status message] to *Writing offsets to log*.

[[walCommit]]
In *walCommit* link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#reportTimeTaken[time-tracking section],
`constructNextBatch` link:spark-sql-streaming-HDFSMetadataLog.adoc#add[adds the offsets in the batch] to <<offsetLog, OffsetSeqLog>>.

[NOTE]
====
While writing the offsets to the metadata log, `constructNextBatch` uses the following internal registries:

* <<currentBatchId, currentBatchId>> for the current batch id

* <<availableOffsets, StreamProgress>> for the available offsets

* <<sources, sources>> for the streaming sources

* <<offsetSeqMetadata, OffsetSeqMetadata>>
====

`constructNextBatch` reports a `AssertionError` when writing to the metadata log has failed.

```
Concurrent update to the log. Multiple streaming jobs detected for [currentBatchId]
```

  },
```
====

`constructNextBatch` commits the offsets for the batch (only when <<currentBatchId, current batch id>> is not ``0``, i.e. when the <<populateStartOffsets-currentBatchId-0, query has just been started>> and `constructNextBatch` is called the first time).

`constructNextBatch` link:spark-sql-streaming-HDFSMetadataLog.adoc#get[takes the previously-committed batch] (from <<offsetLog, OffsetSeqLog>>), extracts the stored offsets per source.

NOTE: `constructNextBatch` uses <<spark-sql-streaming-OffsetSeq.adoc#toStreamProgress, OffsetSeq.toStreamProgress>> and <<sources, sources>> registry to extract the offsets per source.

`constructNextBatch` requests every streaming source to link:spark-sql-streaming-Source.adoc#commit[commit the offsets]

NOTE: `constructNextBatch` uses the `Source` contract to link:spark-sql-streaming-Source.adoc#commit[commit the offsets] (using `Source.commit` method).

`constructNextBatch` reports a `IllegalStateException` when <<currentBatchId, current batch id>> is `0`.

```
batch [currentBatchId] doesn't exist
```

[[constructNextBatch-purge]]
In the end, `constructNextBatch` purges <<offsetLog, OffsetSeqLog>> and <<batchCommitLog, BatchCommitLog>> when <<currentBatchId, current batch id>> is above link:spark-sql-streaming-properties.adoc#spark.sql.streaming.minBatchesToRetain[spark.sql.streaming.minBatchesToRetain] Spark property.

==== [[constructNextBatch-hasNewData-false]] No New Data Available

If there is no new data available, `constructNextBatch` acquires a lock on <<awaitProgressLock, awaitProgressLock>>, wakes up all waiting threads that are waiting for the stream to progress (using <<awaitProgressLockCondition, awaitProgressLockCondition>>), followed by releasing the lock on <<awaitProgressLock, awaitProgressLock>>.

=== [[runBatch]] Running Single Streaming Micro-Batch -- `runBatch` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
runBatch(sparkSessionToRunBatch: SparkSession): Unit
----

`runBatch` performs the following steps (aka _phases_):

1. <<runBatch-getBatch, getBatch Phase -- Requesting New (and Hence Unprocessed) Data From Streaming Sources>>
1. <<runBatch-withNewSources, withNewSources Phase -- Replacing StreamingExecutionRelations (in Logical Plan) With Relations With New Data or Empty LocalRelation>>
1. <<runBatch-triggerLogicalPlan, triggerLogicalPlan Phase -- Transforming Catalyst Expressions>>
1. <<runBatch-queryPlanning, queryPlanning Phase -- Creating IncrementalExecution for Current Streaming Batch>>
1. <<runBatch-nextBatch, nextBatch Phase -- Creating Dataset (with IncrementalExecution for New Data)>>
1. <<runBatch-addBatch, addBatch Phase -- Adding Current Streaming Batch to Sink>>
1. <<runBatch-awaitBatchLock, awaitBatchLock Phase -- Waking Up Threads Waiting For Stream to Progress>>

NOTE: `runBatch` is used when...FIXME

==== [[runBatch-getBatch]] getBatch Phase -- Requesting New (and Hence Unprocessed) Data From Streaming Sources

Internally, `runBatch` first requests the link:spark-sql-streaming-Source.adoc[streaming sources] for unprocessed data (and stores them as `DataFrames` in <<newData, newData>> internal registry).

In *getBatch* link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#reportTimeTaken[time-tracking section], `runBatch` goes over the <<availableOffsets, available offsets per source>> and processes the offsets that <<committedOffsets, have not been committed yet>>.

`runBatch` then requests link:spark-sql-streaming-Source.adoc#getBatch[every source for the data] (as `DataFrame` with the new records).

NOTE: `runBatch` requests the streaming sources for new DataFrames sequentially, source by source.

.StreamExecution's Running Single Streaming Batch (getBatch Phase)
image::images/StreamExecution-runBatch-getBatch.png[align="center"]

`runBatch` prints out the following DEBUG message to the logs:

```
Retrieving data from [source]: [current] -> [available]
```

`runBatch` prints out the following DEBUG message to the logs:

```
getBatch took [timeTaken] ms
```

==== [[runBatch-withNewSources]] withNewSources Phase -- Replacing StreamingExecutionRelations (in Logical Plan) With Relations With New Data or Empty LocalRelation

.StreamExecution's Running Single Streaming Batch (withNewSources Phase)
image::images/StreamExecution-runBatch-withNewSources.png[align="center"]

In *withNewSources* phase, `runBatch` transforms <<logicalPlan, logical query plan>> and replaces every link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingExecutionRelation.adoc[StreamingExecutionRelation] logical operator with the logical plan of the `DataFrame` with the input data in a batch for the corresponding streaming source.

NOTE: link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingExecutionRelation.adoc[StreamingExecutionRelation] logical operator is used to represent a streaming source in the <<logicalPlan, logical query plan>> of a streaming `Dataset`.

`runBatch` finds the corresponding `DataFrame` (with the input data) per streaming source in <<newData, newData>> internal registry. If found, `runBatch` takes the logical plan of the `DataFrame`. If not, `runBatch` creates a `LocalRelation` logical relation (for the output schema).

NOTE: <<newData, newData>> internal registry contains entries for streaming sources that have new data available in the current batch.

While replacing `StreamingExecutionRelation` operators, `runBatch` records the output schema of the streaming source (from `StreamingExecutionRelation`) and the `DataFrame` with the new data (in `replacements` temporary internal buffer).

`runBatch` makes sure that the output schema of the streaming source with a new data in the batch has not changed. If the output schema has changed, `runBatch` reports...FIXME

==== [[runBatch-triggerLogicalPlan]] triggerLogicalPlan Phase -- Transforming Catalyst Expressions

`runBatch` transforms Catalyst expressions in `withNewSources` new logical plan (using `replacements` temporary internal buffer).

* Catalyst `Attribute` is replaced with one if recorded in `replacements` internal buffer (that corresponds to the attribute in the `DataFrame` with the new input data in the batch)

* `CurrentTimestamp` and `CurrentDate` Catalyst expressions are replaced with `CurrentBatchTimestamp` expression (with `batchTimestampMs` from <<offsetSeqMetadata, OffsetSeqMetadata>>).

[NOTE]
====
`CurrentTimestamp` Catalyst expression corresponds to `current_timestamp` function.

Find more about `current_timestamp` function in https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/spark-sql-functions-datetime.html#current_timestamp[Mastering Apache Spark 2] gitbook.
====

[NOTE]
====
`CurrentDate` Catalyst expression corresponds to `current_date` function.

Find more about `current_date` function in https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/spark-sql-functions-datetime.html#current_date[Mastering Apache Spark 2] gitbook.
====

==== [[runBatch-queryPlanning]] queryPlanning Phase -- Creating IncrementalExecution for Current Streaming Batch

.StreamExecution's Query Planning (queryPlanning Phase)
image::images/StreamExecution-runBatch-queryPlanning.png[align="center"]

In *queryPlanning* link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#reportTimeTaken[time-tracking section], `runBatch` link:spark-sql-streaming-IncrementalExecution.adoc#creating-instance[creates] a new `IncrementalExecution` with the following:

* Transformed <<logicalPlan, logical query plan>> with <<runBatch-withNewSources, logical relations>> for every streaming source and <<runBatch-triggerLogicalPlan, corresponding attributes>>

* the streaming query's <<outputMode, output mode>>

* `state` <<checkpointFile, checkpoint directory>> for managing state

* <<runId, current run id>>

* <<currentBatchId, current batch id>>

* <<offsetSeqMetadata, OffsetSeqMetadata>>

The new `IncrementalExecution` is recorded in <<spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#lastExecution, lastExecution>> property.

Before leaving *queryPlanning* section, `runBatch` forces preparation of the physical plan for execution (i.e. requesting <<spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#lastExecution, IncrementalExecution>> for link:spark-sql-streaming-IncrementalExecution.adoc#executedPlan[executedPlan]).

NOTE: link:spark-sql-streaming-IncrementalExecution.adoc#executedPlan[executedPlan] is a physical plan (i.e. `SparkPlan`) ready for execution with link:spark-sql-streaming-IncrementalExecution.adoc#preparations[state optimization rules] applied.

==== [[runBatch-nextBatch]] nextBatch Phase -- Creating Dataset (with IncrementalExecution for New Data)

.StreamExecution Creates DataFrame with New Data
image::images/StreamExecution-runBatch-nextBatch.png[align="center"]

`runBatch` creates a `DataFrame` with the new link:spark-sql-streaming-IncrementalExecution.adoc[IncrementalExecution] (as `QueryExecution`) and its analyzed output schema.

NOTE: The new `DataFrame` represents the result of a streaming query.

==== [[runBatch-addBatch]] addBatch Phase -- Adding Current Streaming Batch to Sink

.StreamExecution Creates DataFrame with New Data
image::images/StreamExecution-runBatch-addBatch.png[align="center"]

In *addBatch* link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#reportTimeTaken[time-tracking section], `runBatch` requests the one and only streaming <<sink, Sink>> to link:spark-sql-streaming-Sink.adoc#addBatch[add the results of a streaming query] (as the `DataFrame` created in <<runBatch-nextBatch, nextBatch Phase>>).

NOTE: `runBatch` uses link:spark-sql-streaming-Sink.adoc#addBatch[Sink.addBatch] method to request the `Sink` to add the results.

NOTE: `runBatch` uses `SQLExecution.withNewExecutionId` to execute and track all the Spark actions (under one execution id) that `Sink` can use when requested to add the results.

NOTE: The new `DataFrame` will only be executed in `Sink.addBatch`.

NOTE: `SQLExecution.withNewExecutionId` posts a `SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart` event before executing `Sink.addBatch` and a `SparkListenerSQLExecutionEnd` event right afterwards.

[TIP]
====
Register `SparkListener` to get notified about the SQL execution events.

You can find more information on `SparkListener` in https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/spark-SparkListener.html[Mastering Apache Spark 2] gitbook.
====

==== [[runBatch-awaitBatchLock]] awaitBatchLock Phase -- Waking Up Threads Waiting For Stream to Progress

In *awaitBatchLock* code block (it is not a time-tracking section), `runBatch` acquires a lock on <<awaitProgressLock, awaitProgressLock>>, wakes up all waiting threads on <<awaitProgressLockCondition, awaitProgressLockCondition>> and immediatelly releases <<awaitProgressLock, awaitProgressLock>> lock.

NOTE: <<awaitProgressLockCondition, awaitProgressLockCondition>> is used mainly when `StreamExecution` <<processAllAvailable, processAllAvailable>> (and also when `awaitOffset`, but that seems mainly for testing).

=== [[stop]] `stop` Method
